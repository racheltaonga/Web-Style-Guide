# Front End Techdegree Project 4 - Web Style Guide
 
 In this project, I was provided with a completed index.html and styles.css files. I was responsible for converting the CSS into Sass by splitting the code into several Sass partial files. I was also responsible in looking for repeaated values (length units, colors etc) throughput the CSS and storing them in Sass variables. Upon completion, the project provided me with Sass micro-framework that I can use to quickly prototype other websites. 

 I went for the Exceeds Expectations Grading where I had to: 

 1. Create a Flexbox mixin to apply to all Flexbox properties used in the project. 
 2. Create a media query mixin to apply to all the media queries in the project. 

 Browsers tested for compatibility: 

 1. Chrome 
 2. Firefox
 3. Edge

 Grade: Exceeds Expecatations
